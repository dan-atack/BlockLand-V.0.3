This is my first attempt at a game, from scratch, that will run in the browser using the lessons learned in our DOM modules and
some good old Vanilla JS.

Version 0.1 features: A world with a few different 'block types' you can run around on, and a screen that scrolls
around out to a fixed location that is controlled in the game's Constants file... Interesting things like enemies and
the ability to die and missions all coming soon!
