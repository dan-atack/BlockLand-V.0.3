This is my first attempt at a game, from scratch, that will run in the browser using the lessons learned in our DOM modules and
some good old Vanilla JS.

Version 0.1 features: A world with a few different 'block types' you can run around on, and a screen that scrolls
around out to a fixed location that is controlled in the game's Constants file... Interesting things like enemies and
the ability to die and missions all coming soon!

Version 0.2.0 features:
* New physics engine that gets you 'off the grid' and introduces such concepts as friction, gravity, and a more sophisticated approach to collision detection
* New blocks, including ice, trees, wood, bricks, and... bacon!?
* Mission/objectives system to guide the player's journey (currently sending you to visit the edges of the world and return a couple of times) and reward achievements with XP (currently worthless)
* Portals to other dimensions (terrain is re-generated to simulate the transition to another world)
* DEATH! (And the ability to restart the game without using the 'refresh' button)

Coming in version 0.3.0:
* Game will be on a server
* SCSS
* Maybe some baddies, but let's not get too carried away just yet ;)

Coming in versions distant:
* Flying (not the buggy kind that first occurred due to an insensitive ground-collision system)
* XP lets you buy upgrades for your character
* Items
* Bad guys who shoot at you and drop stuff
* HP
* Much, much more!!!
