This is my first attempt at a game, from scratch, that will run in the browser using the lessons learned in our DOM modules.

The purpose of this, aside from being a whole lot of fun, is to thoroughly practice with my skills involving html, css and dom
object manipulation, but more importantly to build on my core Javascript skills and use them to develop some more complex and abstract
stuff - really push the envelope.

This might not turn into Dinosaurs vs Nazis, the videogame... but you never know ;)
